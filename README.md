# Heart Failure Prediction 

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart failure in patients using machine learning techniques. Heart failure is a critical health condition with high morbidity and mortality rates. Early detection and prediction of heart failure can lead to better patient outcomes by enabling timely interventions and treatments. In this project, we explore various machine learning models to predict heart failure based on medical data and physiological measurements.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered medical data related to heart failure, including patient demographics, clinical features, and physiological measurements.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Decision Tree (DT)
   - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
   - Random Forest

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow/keras (for ANN)
